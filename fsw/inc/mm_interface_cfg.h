/**
 * \brief Maximum number of bytes for an uninterruptable load
 *
 *  \par Description:
 *       Maximum number of bytes that can be loaded with the
 *       "memory load with interrupts disabled" (#MM_LOAD_MEM_WID_CC)
 *       command.
 *
 *  \par Limits:
 *       This parameter is limited to the size of an uint8 which
 *       is the data type used to specify the number of bytes to
 *       load in the command message.
 *
 *       If this data type is made bigger, changing this value to a
 *       large number will increase the amount of time interrupts are
 *       disabled during the load. It should also be kept small enough
 *       to avoid packet segmentation for the command protocal being
 *       used.
