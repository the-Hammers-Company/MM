 *  \par Criticality
 *       It is the responsibility of the user to verify the
 * <i>DestSymAddress</i>, and <i>NumOfBytes</i> in the command.  It is highly
 * recommended to verify the success or failure of the memory fill.  The fill
 * may be verified by dumping memory and evaluating the dump contents.  It is
 * possible to destroy critical information with this command causing unknown
 * consequences.  In addition, it is possible to generate a machine check
 * exception when accessing I/O memory addresses/registers and other types of
 * memory. The user is cautioned to use extreme care.
 *
 *       Note: Valid memory ranges are defined within a hardcoded structure
 * contained in the PSP layer (CFE_PSP_MemoryTable) however, not every address
 * within the defined ranges may be valid.
